# Mobile-and-Web-Applications-with-jQuery-
Here will be using the Mobile jQuery library to build a list style mobile web app. list will be generated from a JSON file that you will need to source from the web or hand code. Suggestions on useful free online data sources will be offered throughout the course. Your Approach should be modular enough that replacing the JSON with similarly formed data will still allow the code to function (i.e. assuming the data has a defined structure). You can make your site/app about anything that interests you. For example, you might want to do a movie reviews app, a restaurant picker, a video jukebox, etc.
